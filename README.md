### 1 - Project Framing

Project framing consists in defining the goals and designing the strategy to reach these goals, taking into account contextual constraints.

### 2 - Data Collection

Data collection consists in gathering the data stored into an external source.
This source can be the client's IT system, a website, or any data source.

### 3 - Data Transformation

Data transformation consists in 2 steps:
- clearing the data
- mapping the data to a model

### 4 - Data Analysis

Data analysis consists in explaining, using the data, the underlying phenomenon.

### 5 - Data Visualization

Data visualization consists in making the finding of the previous step understandable to a non data scientist.
